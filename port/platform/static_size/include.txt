# This file should contain the paths to all header files that are
# required for ubxlib EXCEPT those related to a platform or to tests
# or to examples, i.e. only core ubxlib functionality.
# Putting it another way: do NOT add paths to test, platform-specific
# or example code here. If you find that this does not build unless
# you do so then either (a) there is a problem in the core code,
# it is trying to pull in headers that it should not or (b) a new
# pan-platform thing has been added (e.g. a new #define which appears
# in all the platform cfg header files, another U_CFG_APP_xxx) and
# that needs to be added to the stubs.
# Paths are relative to the ubxlib root directory, forward-slashes must be used.
