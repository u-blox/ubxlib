# This file should contain the paths to all header files that are
# required for ubxlib on the Arduino platform.  Do not include
# test or example directories.
# Paths are relative to the ubxlib root directory, forward-slashes
# must be used.
# Header files are included in the order listed.
# Generally only directories are listed here, though it is
# possible to include a file name also.
