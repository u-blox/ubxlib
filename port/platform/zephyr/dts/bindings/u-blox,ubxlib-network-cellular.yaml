        default: 1800
        description: "The timeout when connecting to the network in seconds; this is a LOOONG time in case you are using an NB1 network, where initial search can take many many minutes; if you are NOT using an NB1 network specify a shorter time (e.g. 240 seconds), or alternatively in your code you may specify a timeout callback, see /common/network/api/u_network_config_cell.h."
