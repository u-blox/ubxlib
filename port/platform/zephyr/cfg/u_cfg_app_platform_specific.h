/** @file
 * @brief This header file contains configuration information for
 * a Zephyr platform that is fed in at application level, with one
 * exception (see below).  It assumes an nRF5x MCU, e.g. nRF52840 or
 * nRF5340. You should override these values as necessary for your particular
 * platform.
 * Note that the pin numbers used below should be those of the MCU: if you
 * are using an MCU inside a u-blox module the IO pin numbering for
 * the module is likely different to that from the MCU: check the data
 * sheet for the module to determine the mapping.
 *
 * Also, note that the convention used by each platform SDK for pin
 * numbering is different: some platform SDKs use physical pin numbers,
 * others a bit-position in a register bank, or sometimes a bit-position
 * in a register bank plus an index to that bank: expect no commonality!
 *
 * In the case of Zephyr for the NRF52 and NRF53 platforms the number
 * refers to a bit-position in a register bank plus the index of that
 * register bank; you must refer to the data sheet for your chip to
 * determine which physical pin number that logical GPIO comes out on
 * (and then, if your chip is inside a u-blox module, the data sheet
 * for the u-blox module to determine what module pin number it comes
 * out on).  This is not simple!
 *
 * Specifically, there are 32 GPIO lines on each register bank,
 * referred to as a "port", and two ports, so bit 0 of port 0 is GPIO0
 * and you would refer to it as 0, bit 31 of port 0 is GPIO31 and you
 * would refer to it as 31, bit 0 of port 1 is GPIO32 and you would
 * refer to it as 32 and bit 15 of port 1 is GPIO 47 (the second port
 * is only half used), referred to as 47.
 *
 * Also, if you are using one of the DK boards from Nordic, a load of
 * the pins have pre-assigned functions so you have to read the back of
 * the PCB _very_ carefully to find any that are free.  In
 * general, port 1 is freer than port 0, hence the choices below.
 *
 * EXCEPTION: U_CFG_APP_PIN_CELL_DTR is a compile-time configuration
 * built into this code rather than passed in as a run-time parameter.
 * It is required where a cellular module is connected which must be
 * allowed to enter power saving mode and, also, HW flow control is
 * required on the UART interface to that cellular module. See the notes
 * above the pin definition below for further details.

/** Required for Zephyr device tree query:
 * Since U_CFG_APP_CELL_UART is a macro, DT_CAT() won't work on it

 * then U_CFG_APP_CAT(uart, U_CFG_APP_CELL_UART) spits out uart1.
