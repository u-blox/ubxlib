# This file should contain the paths to all header and source
# files that are required for building ubxlib on PlatformIO.
# Paths are relative to the ubxlib root directory, forward-slashes
# must be used.
# Note that test/automation and the examples from the ubxlib root
# directory are NOT brought in here since they are not required for
# normal use: for those see inc_src_test.txt.
# Framework specific directories will only be included for the
# actual framework used and ignored otherwise.
# For references to the current build framework the macro
# $FRAMEWORK can be used.

# Ubxlib also by default uses its own wrapper of malloc which calls
# k_malloc. The heap size is controlled by the kconfig variable
# CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE. The variable CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC_MALLOC
# must also be set. All this is done in prj.conf
# If you want to use the default heap manager from the C library you
# should remove the file below. Please note that you also need to set
# the config variable CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC_MALLOC_ARENA_SIZE to the
# desired size for the heap in this case.
